We've seen how you can add [custom touch icons for iPhone/iPad use](http://phrappe.com/markup/how-to-attach-a-custom-apple-iphoneipad-icon-to-your-website/ "How to attach a custom apple iPhone/iPad icon to your website") (if you need more information have a look at [Mathias Bynens excellent article on this topic](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons "Everything you always wanted to know about touch icons")) but did you know that you can add custom start-up images (aka splash screens)? Well you can and it's very easy, just prepare your images (for various resolutions, retina displays etc, that's the tough part) and use the below markup to include them. A very easy way to polish your web app and impress your mobile/tablet visitors.
