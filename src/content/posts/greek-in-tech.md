**[Greek in Tech](http://greekintech.com/)** is my latest side project and is finally live! As you can see, it's a very simple **single-page application** (**SPA**) that displays greek words we use in technology. [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is hosting/serving everything, and the application is based on [Backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org/) framework and [Requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) module loader. Feel free to contribute and spread the word!
