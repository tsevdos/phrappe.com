Finally, I found the time to update the [Greek in Tech](http://greekintech.com) site and create my very first [**npm package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/greek-in-tech)! The idea was to extract all the entries from the [backbone single page application](https://github.com/tsevdos/greek-in-tech-site), create a very simple API for all these data / entries and distribute them as an **npm package**. That way, I could easily use it as a **dependency** to the SPA site, with all the benefits of an npm module like reusability, easier maintenance, single responsibility etc.

You can still contribute entries on the [**package's official repository**](https://github.com/tsevdos/greek-in-tech) learn more about it from its [**official npm page**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/greek-in-tech) (yes the package's name is still [**greek-in-tech**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/greek-in-tech)). Feel free to use it on your own projects and star it if you like it!
