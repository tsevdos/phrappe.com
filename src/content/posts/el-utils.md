I'm extremely proud and happy to announce my latest npm package [**elUtils**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tsevdos/el-utils)! The specific package is a must-have for all developers who build **greek applications** in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_overview)! The package has zero dependencies and works in all runtimes, including **browser**, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [bun](https://bun.sh/) and soon [deno](https://deno.com/). For a more technical look at the implementation, it's written in **TypeScript**, its test coverage is 100% and is strongly-typed.

The package contains a large collection of helper functions that are really helpful when you are building **greek applications**, such as geolocation data, dates, formating, validations, and much more. Finally all these data are available both in **english** and **greek** languages.

Take a look at the [current API](https://paka.dev/npm/@tsevdos/el-utils) and the [live demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/elutils-demo-r8sphg) for more details, and of course feel free [to contribute to the project](https://github.com/tsevdos/elUtils)!
