I just wanted to dedicate this post to the generous translators of the [Ambrosia theme](http://phrappe.com/ambrosia-theme/ "Ambrosia theme"). The theme made it to [version 1.1.5](http://wordpress.org/themes/ambrosia "Ambrosia theme") and although I maintain it (making sure it works with every new WordPress version), some people are providing valuable support by contributing their translations. So far the theme is available in English, French (Nicolas Rouichi), Serbian (Andrijana Nikolic) and Romanian (Alexander Ovsov). So if you want your name to appear at the theme's [official page](http://phrappe.com/ambrosia-theme/ "Ambrosia Theme") and [repository](https://github.com/tsevdos/Ambrosia "Ambrosia theme repository"), you know what you have to do ðŸ˜‰
