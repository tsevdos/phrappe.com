**[Repocompare.io](http://repocompare.io)** is my latest pet project! With this single page application (SPA) you can quickly and easily search and compare [Github](https://github.com/) repositories. If you need a quick and elegant way to compare projects on how many stars, forks, and issues they have, then just visit **[Repocompare.io](http://repocompare.io)** and enjoy!

From a technical point of view, this project is built on [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (and [babel](https://babeljs.io/)) and is using **ES6** and **JSX** (**ES2015** to be more precise). The project is based on Facebook's new beast, [**React**](https://facebook.github.io/react/). As a state management, I'm using [**MobX**](https://mobx.js.org/), and many components and tools from React's ecosystem, such as [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [React Autocomplete](https://github.com/reactjs/react-autocomplete). The test suite/framework is Facebook's [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), which looks and feels really fast. Finally, I used for the very first time [**CSS modules**](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), a nice implementation of **CSS** that plays nicely with React's components.

For those who want to contribute I've already set up a [project with tasks on Github](https://github.com/tsevdos/repocompare/projects/1), so feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/tsevdos/repocompare), especially on the design!
