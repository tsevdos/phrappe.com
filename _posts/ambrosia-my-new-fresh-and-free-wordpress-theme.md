In case you missed it, this blog "wears" a new theme called **[Ambrosia](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/ambrosia "Ambrosia theme")**. **Ambrosia** is my second theme contribution on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress.org") and is free for everyone, under the [GPL 2 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html "GPL 2 license"). **Ambrosia** is easy to install and customize, supports the new wordpress **custom menus** and comes with **4 different widget areas**! For more information on the theme, it’s **features** and **customization options**, please have a look at the **[theme’s official page](http://phrappe.com/ambrosia-theme/ "Ambrosia's theme official page")**.

I will also start a series of "how was Ambrosia built" with more in-depth information and interesting wordpress code.

Until the next post, take care, **[download the theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/ambrosia "Download Ambrosia theme")** (it’s free after all), and spread the word.
