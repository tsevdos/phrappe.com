Hi all, I'm very happy to announce my first grunt project that will definitely help you if you are a **web designer**. What I tried to accomplish was to build a grunt task list that will provide much of the [**CodeKit**](http://incident57.com/codekit/ "CodeKit") functionality and convenience by running simple grunt tasks (commands). Some of the features the grunt tasks provide are listed below:

- **SMACSS** (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) ready infrastructure
- Compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Sass") files
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/ "Compass") and [Burbon](http://bourbon.io/ "Bourbon") support
- JsLinter
- CSS, JS and HTML minification
- Image optimization
- Live-reload

Have a look at the [official repository](https://github.com/tsevdos/Grunt-boilerplate-for-web-designers "Grunt boilerplate for web designers") and don't hesitate to contact me for any suggestions/thoughts. More details on how to use it will be provided on an upcoming screencast (stay tuned). Also feel free to contribute, fork, star etc ðŸ˜‰
