Once again (and hopefully for the last time) I moved all my code snippets to [**Codepen**](http://codepen.io/ "Codepen"). I think it better suits my needs since most of my code examples are front end related and **Codepen** has a tremendous advantage there, because it allows you to publish full HTML, CSS and JS solutions and see the final output instantly! The social features it provides are also impressive, you can fork a "pen", play with it, republish it etc, and finally it looks really good (excellent choice of color palette) and it's very customisable.

You can view my [**profile**](http://codepen.io/tsevdos "Tsevdos Codepen profile") and play with my [pens](http://codepen.io/tsevdos/public/ "Tsevdos public codepens "), don't forget to follow me ðŸ˜‰ My [gist list](https://gist.github.com/tsevdos "Tsevdos Gist list") will remain and I'll continue posting there as well, but mostly only server side code such as PHP scripts.
