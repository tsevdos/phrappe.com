IE sucks big time, period! Even version 8 doesnâ€™t support many useful CSS rules such as border radius and box shadow, both standard things for 2010. For those who already use all the nice CSS3 features that IE doesn't support, try [CSS3 PIE](http://css3pie.com/ "CSS3 PIE"). The installation is easy (you only need to upload one file and that's it) and after that, you'll finally force IE to support [many CSS3 features](http://css3pie.com/documentation/supported-css3-features/ "Supported CSS3 Features") such as border-radius, box-shadow, border-image, multiple background images, linear backgrounds, rgba as well as some other features. Give it a try, it's not bad at all (plus you keep all the behavior inside your CSS file, you don't need to write/code/attach any Javascript code).
