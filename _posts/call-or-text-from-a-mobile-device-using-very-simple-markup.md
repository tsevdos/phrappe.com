At my [latest presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/tsevdos/pragmatic-responsive-web-design "Pragmatic Responsive Web Design") (at [upNorth web conferce](http://www.upnorthconf.gr "upNorth web Conference") in Greece), people were impressed with some very trivial markup that can add many points to your mobile site (and not only) with minimum effort. With the below very easy to implement markup you can make your site interact with the device in order to make phone calls and/or send sms (I only tested it with iPhone but I believe its working on other devices as well)!

```html
<a href="tel:+306948123456">call me</a>
<a href="sms:+306948123456">text me</a>
```

The above enhancements, together with a [custom iOS home screen icon/image](http://phrappe.com/markup/how-to-attach-a-custom-apple-iphoneipad-icon-to-your-website/ "How to attach a custom apple iPhone/iPad icon to your website"), are probably the easiest markup implementations that give to your mobile site/app&nbsp;many&nbsp;more extra points! If you've tested the above example with other devices (android, windows, blackberry, etc.) please confirm that it's working (just leave a comment)...
